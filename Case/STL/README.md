# General info

STLs for 3D printing (on your printer or by order).

For the front panel, you can select either the engraved/debossed version which is very nice with filament change (start with transparent and change to another color, to have light from the optional internal LEDs to shine through the logo text) and the embossed version which you can print 1-color or also multi-color with a different text color.

The purge tower file is a recommendation if you are, like me, using an FDM printer and want to use the "Filament change" command to change the color of the labelling text. Details in the documentation in the slicing chapter.

FreeCAD case project in the FreeCAD folder.
